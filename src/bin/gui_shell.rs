//! # GUI Shell Binary
//!
//! This binary is intended to provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the `comp-gate` system.
//! It will serve as a user-friendly alternative to the command-line `shell` binary.
//!
//! ## Planned Features
//!
//! - Visual representation of the device tree.
//! - Real-time updates of device connection status.
//! - Interactive controls to enable/disable devices.
//! - Management of the device whitelist.
//!
//! ## Current Status
//!
//! This is currently a placeholder entry point. The implementation is planned to use
//! a Rust GUI framework (likely `egui`) to communicate with the core service via the IOAPI.
